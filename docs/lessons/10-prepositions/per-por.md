# 10.3. Per vs Por
## 10.3.1. The History of "Per" and "Por"
The prepositions "per" and "por" as we know them in Neolatin have specific origins. To understand why these prepositions exist as they do in Neolatin, we must first examine their cognates in Classical Latin.


1. Ā, Ab, Abs [From (separation), Out of, By (personal agent), Since]
2. Dē [From, Away from, About/Concerning]
3. Prō [For, In favor of, In place of]
4. Per [Through, During, By means of]

### The Iberian Peninsula
Starting with Romance languages of the Iberian peninsula, we see "por" and "para" in Spanish and Portuguese.

Examining the origin of "por":

Prō ➜ Pōr ➜ Por

"Prō" went through a process called "metathesis", which is when sounds or syllables change from one position in a word to another. This happened because of the influence of the similar preposition "per". Spanish and Portuguese inherit "por" from "prō". However, they did not inherit the prepositions "ab" or "per". "Por" assumed the functions of the Latin "per", despite its appearance originally being from "prō". 

Examining the origin of "para":

Por a ["Por" + "A"] ➜ Pora ➜ Para

To supplement other uses, "por a" came into being, which eventually became "por a" (composed of the new preposition "por" and the inherited "a" from Latin "ad"). Through a process called "assimilation", where one sound of a word becomes more like another sound in the word, "pora" finally became "para".

In short, "por" and "para" more or less corresponds to "per" and "prō" in Classical Latin.

In a similar fashion, Catalan has "per" and "per a", having the same meanings in "por" and "para" in Spanish and Portuguese. The difference is that "per" was wholly inherited in appearance from "per" in Latin, instead of conflating "per" and "prō".

### Italian
In the case of Italian, a similar displacement happened, but with a different preposition. "Per" in Italian was inherited from "per", but it also took functions from "prō".

Italian inherited "ab" in the form of the preposition "da", composed of "dē" and "ā/ab". What makes "da" particular was that other languages did not conserve "ab" and that some of its uses more commonly correspond to "de" in other modern Romance languages.

### French
French inherited "pour" from "prō" and "par" from "per". Curiously, despite the divergence of the French language in other aspects, these prepositions are largely conservative in their meanings from Latin. Their meanings and appearance most closely resemble the ideal Pan-Romance uses.


### Romanian
Like other Romance languages, Romanian inherits its prepositions, but due to its isolation from other Romance languages, these prepositions have more divergent meanings.

"Pe" comes from the Latin "per", conserving some key meanings like "through" and "approximately". However, unlike other languages, its meaning was also influenced by "super" (meaning "above" or "on top of") to mean "on" with contact.

"De" was inherited from "dē", but has some key innovative meanings that make it different from direct cognates in other Romance languages. Some examples are "de" being the preposition that mark the agent of a passive verb (ex: A book written by Jose Marti), which was a function "ab" had in Latin or indicating the reason behind something (ex: We cannot see because of the fog).

"Pentru" is an evolution of the Latin "per intrō", with a meaning closest to the original Latin "prō".

In summary, "pe" mixes the functions of "per" and "super", "de" mixes the functions of "dē" with "ab" and "per", and "pentru" is a new preposition created more or less resembling the use of "prō",

### Conclusions
As we have seen, due to a shift in meanings and a mix of functions of inherited prepositions, communicating with these prepositions is more difficult than some may think at first glance.

To ensure comprehension, Neolatin examines both the original meaning of prepositions in Classical Latin and compares prepositions in modern Romance languages to reach a conclusion.

The next sections demonstrate the uses of "per" and "por" in Neolatin.

## 10.3.4. More Information

Some more pieces of information:

1. The preposition "per ad" is possible. However, this preposition is somewhat tricky. This preposition is modelled after cognates in Iberia ("para" in Spanish and Portuguese, and "per a" in Catalan). The Iberian prepositions "por" and "para" do not perfectly align with the Neolatin "per" and "por".
2. Similarly, in Iberian languages, due to the distinction between "por" and "para", there is a difference in meaning between something like "trabajar por" (to work in support of something or substituting another person) and "trabajar para" (like working directly for an employer). This distinction is not seen in other Romance languages. That being said, some may prefer to keep this distinction in the form of "trepallîare per" and "trepallîare per ad/por".
3. "Per" and "por" are used in forming the following words with different meanings. Firstly, the adverb "per que", which means "why" (the explanation or cause). Secondly, the conjunction "por que", which means "so that" or "in order to" (purpose).
