To use double object pronouns with infinitives or commands (the imperative form), attach them to the end of the verb.

To use double object pronouns with gerunds, use one of the following methods: 
* Place the pronouns before the first verb.
* Attach them to the second verb.

| Infinitive | Voleva dare-les-lo. |I wanted to give it to them. |
| Imperative | Da-me-lo. | Give it to me.|
