# 13.1. Negation with "Non"

## 13.1.1. The Negative Adverb "Non"
To negate a verb in Neolatin, use the adverb "**non**" before the verb.

|       |     |
|:-------------:|:-------------:|
| **Non**  parlo neolatino. | I do **not** speak Neolatin. |
| **Non**  havemos mangîato. | We have **not** eaten. |

The same rule applies for interrogative sentences.

|       |     |
|:-------------:|:-------------:|
| Non has la clave? | Don't you have the key? |
| Non lo has visto? | Haven't you seen it? / Didn't you see it? |
| María non espera lo autobus? | Isn't Maria waiting for the bus? |
| Lo bebé non dòrme? | The baby isn't sleeping? |

## 13.1.2. Negative Responses to Questions
If the answer to a question is negative, respond to the question with the answer "non", and use the adverb "non" to negate the verb.

|       |     |
|:-------------:|:-------------:|
| Sapes como condúcere? | Do you know how to drive? |
| Non, non sao. | No, I don't know. |

|       |     |
|:-------------:|:-------------:|
| Vòles un pomo? | Do you want an apple? |
| Non, non vòllîo un pomo. | No, I don’t want an apple. |

:::note

Remember that the word for “no” and “not” is both “non” in Neolatin.

## 13.1.3. Using “Non” With Object Pronouns
In the case of sentences with direct or indirect object pronouns, place the negative adverb "non" before all object pronouns.

|       |     |
|:-------------:|:-------------:|
| Non me parles. | Don't talk to me. |
| Non se me haveva occorruto. | It had not occurred (itself) to me. |
| Non lo conosco. | I don't know him. |
| Non me lo has mostrato. | You have not shown me it. |

In the case of most verb tenses that have a clear subject performing the action (meaning, not an impersonal expression or the imperative), in addition to placing "non" before all object pronouns, place the subject pronoun before "non".
|       |     |
|:-------------:|:-------------:|
| (Èo) non lo conosco. | I don't know him. |
| (Tu) non me lo has mostrato. | You have not shown me it. |

Remember that subject pronouns are usually not used with the conjugation.
