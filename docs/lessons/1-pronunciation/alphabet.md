# 1.1. Alphabet
Like Romance languages, Neolatin uses the Latin alphabet. It consists of the traditional Roman alphabet  `<A, B, C, D, E,...>` expanded with the new letters `<J, U, W>`  and the Greek letters `<Y, Z>`, both uppercase and lowercase.

The letters `<k>, <w>, <y>` and `<z>` are mainly used in technical words of international use and in non-Romanized loanwords.

[^1]: The names `fe, le, me, ne, re, se, ye` follow the model set by the names `be, ce, de, ge, pe, te`, which are forms that are already present with the long e, `ē` ,in Latin (`ve` did not exist yet as a distinct letter from `u`). Those regularized forms (except `ye`, which is a Spanish creation) are found as variants in French (according to the Littré dictionary) and Romanian.
[^2]: Latin had the names `ĕf, ĕl, ĕm, ĕn, ĕr, ĕs`, from which came the Romance forms `èf/èffe,èl/èlle`, etc. The etymological variant is found in Catalan (rarely used now), French and Romanian; the extended variant in Portuguese, Spanish (the form that Catalan now also uses) and Italian.
[^3]: The name *je* (systematic with *be*, *ce*, *de*, etc.) can be used in its written form without any problem. Orally, it could be confused with *ge*; therefore, the descriptive name *i lònga* is a safer option.
