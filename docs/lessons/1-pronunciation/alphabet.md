# 1.1. Alphabet ✅
Like Romance languages, Neolatin uses the Latin alphabet. It consists of the traditional Roman alphabet  `<A, B, C, D, E,...>` expanded with the new letters `<J, U, W>`  and the Greek letters `<Y, Z>`, both uppercase and lowercase.

The letters `<k>`, `<w>`, `<y>` and `<z>` are mainly used in technical words of international use and in non-Romanized loanwords.

[^1]: The names *fe*, *le*, *me*, *ne*, *re*, *se*, *ye* follow the model set by the names *be*, *ce*, *de*, *ge*, *pe*, *te*, which are forms that are already present with the long e, *ē* ,in Latin (*ve* did not exist yet as a distinct letter from *u*). Those regularized forms (except *ye*, which is a Spanish creation) are found as variants in French (according to the Littré dictionary) and Romanian.
[^2]: Latin had the names *ĕf*, *ĕl*, *ĕm*, *ĕn*, *ĕr*, *ĕs*, from which came the Romance forms *èf*/*èffe*,*èl*/*èlle*, etc. The etymological variant is found in Catalan (rarely used now), French and Romanian; the extended variant in Portuguese, Spanish (the form that Catalan now also uses) and Italian.
[^3]: The name *je* (systematic with *be*, *ce*, *de*, etc.) can be used in its written form without any problem. Orally, it could be confused with *ge*; therefore, the descriptive name *i lònga* is a safer option.
