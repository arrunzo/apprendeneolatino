# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## 1. What is Neolatin (Romance Neolatino)?

Neolatin is a constructed zonal auxiliary language designed to make communication easier between speakers of Romance languages. It draws from a common base of Romance vocabulary and grammar. 

Furthermore, rather than being a language in and of itself, it can also be treated as a standard of Pan-Romance communication.

## 2. What does "auxiliary language" mean?

An auxiliary language is a language that is meant to serve as a supplement to one's own native language, not to replace living languages. Neolatin specifically is a "zonal auxiliary language", which means that not only is it intended to be used alongside one's own native language, but also that that Neolatin is based on a specific group of languages (Romance languages, and only Romance languages).  The purpose of Neolatin is to make communication easier between speakers of Romance languages in a way that is both neutral and natural.

## 3. How do I learn Neolatin?

## 4. How long does it take to learn Neolatin?

## 5. Can speakers of all Romance languages understand Neolatin?

## 6. If I learn Neolatin, will I understand other Romance languages?

## 7. Why does Neolatin use certain diacritics?

## 8. How can I write Neolatin using my keyboard?

## 9. Is there an automatic translator for Neolatin?

## 10. Is there a Wikipedia for Neolatin?
No. In order for there to be a Wikipedia in Neolatin, Neolatin must obtain an ISO 639 code from the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). This code is important because it would prove that Neolatin is a recognized language. Neolatin does not have an ISO 639 code yet, and therefore, cannot apply for the creation of a Neolatin version of Wikipedia.

## 11. Is there a Duolingo course for Neolatin?
No. Duolingo no longer allows community courses. In light of this, we recommend that you use this website to learn Neolatin. There is also a Neolatin version of Duostories, which is an unofficial community project to bring the original Duolingo Stories to new languages.

## 12. Help! I can't find a word!

## 13. Why do we need Neolatin if many people already speak English?
People in Romance-speaking countries typically have poor proficiency in the English language. Neolatin is meant to be a tool

## 14. Why do we need Neolatin when we already have Latin?
Modern Romance languages are closer to each other than they are to Latin.

## 15. Why not use a natural Romance language to serve as a Pan-Romance language?
Certain Romance languages would serve better as a solution for Pan-Romance communication, but no one single Romance language is ideal

## 16. What is the difference between Neolatin and Interlingua/Lingua Franca Nova, etc.?

## 17. Does Neolatin aim to unite Romance-speaking countries into one Romance state?
No. Neolatin is a non-political linguistic project.

## 18. What political stance does Neolatin support? Is it a form of Pan-Latinism?
VÃ­a Neolatina, the organization behind the development and diffusion of Neolatin, does not endorse any political stance. Neolatin is purely a linguistic project.
