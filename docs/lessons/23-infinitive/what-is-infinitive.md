# 23.1. What Is the Infinitive?

The infinitive is the basic, unconjugated form of a verb. It is the form of a verb that appears in dictionaries. 

Because the infinitive is not conjugated, it does not communicate the subject of the action nor when an action happens.

The infinitive has three different endings: 
* -are (cant**are**)
* -ere (vol**ere**)
* -ire (dorm**ire**).

At first glance, the infinitive is equivalent to how the infinitive exists in English, such as the verb "dormire" meaning "to sleep".

This chapter will explain other uses of the infinitive.
